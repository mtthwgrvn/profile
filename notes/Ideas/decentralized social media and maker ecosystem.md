### Decentralized social media and maker ecosystem
1. An innovation ecosystem (users can create apps and other modifications)
	1. Here, I'm thinking of our mobile app stores, but I'm also thinking of the addons and mods users make for World of Warcraft, Minecraft, and several other video games.
	2. Of course, I'm also thinking of the culturally situated design tools, and running simulations
2. Content creation (YouTube, Twitch)
3. Ad supported newsfeed like Facebook/Twitter; the idea here being we will split ad revenues with those users our algorithm targets. So if we get $5 to show an ad to 5 people, each of those people are going to get fifty cents.
	1. While I don't like feeding the ad industry, this seems like a good route through which to allow people to do the things they currently do on social media while owning their data. They might actually begin to appreciate the ad targeting if it means companies they support are essentially paying them for their business.
	2. In this regard, I also thought a bit about payouts. It should be flexible of course, you can sign up your Stripe account, link your bank for direct deposit, save it up for a gift card payout, receive it in the form of crypocurrency.
		1. Then this brings up another idea. Because, obviously you have to start small, so I think this platform Ron wants is a good start and I'm not sure yet where our visions diverge, but you can see how Facebook is cornering the market on a lot of these functionalities for interaction. Ron's social interaction function kind of has to compete with Facebook Groups or Reddit, etc. Obvious pushback is that this is not the case because Ron's intended users already don't use Facebook Groups or Reddit.
			1. I want to create an Amazon of social media and maker platforms. I want people to be incentivized by the fact that they can make money off their data by coming to my platform, they can create a personal storefront like a shopify, or sell their creations in a marketplace like an Amazon on my platform, they can keep up with friends and loved ones, form groups to converse and exchange ideas, etc. etc.


I saw a decentralized social media platform, https://witnessd.com/, made with no code on Bubble.io: https://bubble.io/
No ads. when you post, it automatically tokenizes your content. I don't think text based content is tokenized, just image and video files. In any event, tokenization means getting minted as an NFT. This dapp may be decentralized, but I don't think it's open source. Although as the creator of the NFT, you will earn royalties for life as it is traded, I don't believe they let the user maintain control of the NFT after minting. In an open source platform suitable for CSDT, I would think that the platform would provide minting and a marketplace and other associated tools to manage the NFTs, but that control would be in the hands of the creator.

I am curious as to whether or not this could offer a reduction in risk for the artisan, by allowing them to iterate over their designs to get them just right, as long as each iteration of the design is a variation, all of those variations could be minted and sold as NFTs. So if a user is iterating on a pattern with CSDT, they can upload each iteration to the platform, mint is as an NFT, get feedback from other users/artisans/friends etc., and sell trade it as an NFT, and collect royalties on future trades as the NFT creator.

Would this counter the "shortcoming" of artisans not mass producing?
