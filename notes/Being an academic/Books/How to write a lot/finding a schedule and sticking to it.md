You should be able to defend the time you plan to write. You might schedule writing time at 1-3 pm, but that isn't very defensible because that is the middle of the day when you would typically be having meetings with other people. Of course, this could be a time for your writing group.

In the book, Paul mentions that sometimes faculty will schedule writing time as meetings with each other so that administration can't schedule faculty meetings at that time. Most defensible however, is the early morning or evening. According to Perry, about 2/3 of professional writers write in the morning, and 1/3 in the evening. And this correlates to about 2/3 of adults identifying as morning people. Morning people write in the morning because this is when our candle is burning brightest. I identify as a morning person. So I will naturally be seeking to schedule my writing time in the early morning.

"Self-monitoring—keeping tabs on your own behavior—is one of the oldest and best ways of chang-ing behavior (Korotitsch & Nelson-Gray, 1999). It is based on two sound principles of psychology: (a) people aren’t paying much attention to what they are doing, and (b) even if they are, they delude themselves about their bad habits. But once people keep records of their daily behaviors for a couple weeks and confront their honest daily records of how much money they frittered away, how often they complained, and how many dough-nut holes they gobbled, the stage is set for real change."
