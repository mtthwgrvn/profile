### From the book by Paul J. Silvia, PhD.

Because writing is the process by which we disentangle our often overlapping thoughts and ideas, it is hard. Writing, as Paul says, is a skill rather than a gift. This means that it is something that is learned and can be improved upon. In academia, writing, which was always important, is now more important than ever. On top of this, given the increasing precariousness of work in academia, increasing competition for a dwindling pile of grant money, and technology enabled productivity increases; finding uninterrupted time to write is more difficult than ever.

Paul's approach is to make academic writing more of a mundane routine.

Quotes:

"Writing is a skill, not a gift."

"*How to Write a Lot* views writing as a set of concrete behaviors, such as (a) scheduling time to write; (b) sitting on a chair, bench, stool, ottoman, toilet, or patch of grass during the scheduled time; and (c) slapping your flippers against the keyboard to generate paragraphs. Let everyone else procrastinate, daydream, and complain - spend your time sitting down and flapping your flippers."
