It seems obvious. You write during scheduled writing time. But there is more to writing than just writing. Since I will be writing while reading in order to develop a deeper understanding of the literature, it should follow that I could also read during this time.

More importantly, I think organizing my planner, e.g. Trello, is a good task to do during this time too. Creating, updating cards does involve writing, and it will help me keep better tracks of my goals and progress towards them.

With that said, it seems like I'm trying to accomplish a number of things on the writing front, and they can coalesce around this scheduled writing time.

One of my goals is to develop a good practice for grant writing. Grants are something that have to be tracked, and that is something I can track in Trello. Similarly, journal submissions, conferences and other writing deadlines. Now that I think about it, I will probably have to schedule planning/tracking time alongside writing time instead of incorporating the two. We'll see.

Best to avoid the [[behavioral chatter]] though, something I am definitely guilty of.
