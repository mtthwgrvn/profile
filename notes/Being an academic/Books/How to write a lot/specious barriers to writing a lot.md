Chapter 2 of Paul's work focuses on barriers to writing a lot. He refers to these as [[specious]] barriers.

These barriers include:

1. "I can't find time to write" aka "I would write more if I could find big blocks of time"
2. "I need to do more analysis first" aka "I need to read more articles/books/letters/epigraphs/scrolls"
3. "To write a lot, I need a new computer" (see also "fancy productivity software", "nice office chair", "better desk", "home office")
4. "I'm waiting until I feel like it" aka "I write best when I'm inspired to write"
5. "I should clear the decks before getting down to writing" aka "I'll write even faster later if I wrap all this other stuff up first"


The basic idea here is that we are creative and we'll come of with excuses to get ourselves out of writing. Paul asserts the core of this book is to make a routine out of writing so that you can get it done while still enjoying your life in the evenings and on weekends. And this is a good goal to have, because when you're writing practice is suffering and lacking discipline, you will often use evenings and weekends, holidays and such to do the writing that you've been procrastinating about.
