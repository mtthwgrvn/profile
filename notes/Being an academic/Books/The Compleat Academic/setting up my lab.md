My reading of the title was mistaken. I had thought the lab being referenced was my home office set up for writing my dissertation. This chapter is about starting my own lab after completing my PhD and striking out on my own. I'll return to this note at a later date. For now, I will shift focus to establishing an optimal working relationship with my mentor.

*These concepts are drawn from reading the chapter of a similar name from, "The Compleat Academic" 2nd Edition.*
