### Aesthetic Flattening
This concept refers to the highly reductionist substitute for human interaction in the COVID era.

#### The convergence of three traits in HCI design

1. Sensory: Poor audiovisual interaction (webcam design + mics + data compression + bandwidth)
2. Interface: Reducing interaction from 3D to 2D + loss of body (we only show head and shoulders in Zoom)
3. Justificatory: Design Thinking + Design Systems (Material Design etc.) make business sense for tech stacking and reproducibility.
